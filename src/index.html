  <p>Gun violence is one of our nation’s most significant public health crises with over two million Americans shot since the turn of the millennium Yet gun safety legislation is a non-starter on the federal level and a steep hill to climb in all but a handful of states.</p>

    <h2>Smart guns could save as many as 10,000 lives annually</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Smart gun technology is a proven and promising path to reducing gun violence that could save as many as 10,000 US lives annually. It&rsquo;s supporters range from Alan Gottlieb founder of the Second Amendment Foundation to Dan Gross the Brady Campaign to Alan Chipman of Americans for Gun Responsibility. Two separate surveys including one of almost 4,000 adults by Johns Hopkins University showed that over two out of five gun owners would be interested in buying a smart gun.</p>

    <h2>RFID&rsquo;s proven reliability goes back over 30 years</h2>
  </header>
  <p>The radio frequency identification (RFID)  smart gun involves a &ldquo;digital handshake&rdquo; between the firearm and a computer chip worn  on a ring or bracelet or even implanted in skin. RFID has proven its reliability over a thirty year period in billions of daily operations. Significantly the only commercially available was an RFID handgun developed by famed firearm developer Ernst Mauch. Mr. Mauch’s smart gun was successfully field tested in the cold of Northern Alaska, the humidity of Panama and the sand and heat of the Arizona tested. The smart gun worked but  its marketing five years ago in the US was a disaster for reasons of price, timing and firearm caliber and a state law called the New Jersey Child Proof Smart Gun Mandate.</p>

    <h2>Poor reliability with a biometric smart gun has created concerns for all smart guns</h2>
  </header>
  <p>A lot of money and effort over the past fifteen years has gone into biometric smart guns that are typically activated with a fingerprint. No one however has proven the necessary reliability with the biometric approach and its sensitivity to smudges from sweaty or muddy hands precludes its use by the strategically important law enforcement market. Indeed we believe the ongoing and at times high profile struggle with attaining sufficient reliability with the biometric approach has temporarily at least  help to stall  the entire smart gun mission.</p>

    <h2>The end of a well meaning state law that politicized smart guns over a decade ago</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In 2003 New Jersey pushed through an aggressive law that mandated all firearms sold in that State would be smart guns after the technology was commercially available in the United States. The gun rights group not surprising didn’t like to be told that they could no longer buy their trusted Smith &amp; Wesson and Glocks and pushed back hard. The result was that smart guns availability was stymied and not likely to come around again until the New Jersey Mandate is changed. An amendment to the NJ law was passed by both houses and there is optimism that this legal hurdle will be resolve by the first quarter of 2018 when Governor Christie leaves office.</p>
